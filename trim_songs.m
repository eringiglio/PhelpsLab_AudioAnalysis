function[trimmed_song] = trim_songs(song, samp_freq)

%Decided it was easier to run the thing where the songs were each trimmed,
%had their amplitudes corrected, and put up to the right length in the
%buffer in a separate program rather than in make_stimulus_recording. So
%we'll do this instead. Assumes you've already "read" the song in, because
%make_stimulus_recording will call this. 

%Specifying the sampling frequency...
if nargin <2
    samp_freq = 195312.5;
end

%You want to trim the songs, right? So one easy way to do that might
%be to take the start of the first note and the end of the last note, and
%anything between those things is the trimmed song. So for that, we need to
%measure those things: 
[note_starts, note_ends, note_durs, INI] = msr_note_times(song);

%Specifying the onset and offset of the song itself
onset_song = note_starts(1,1);
offset_song = note_ends(end,end);

%Converting that onset and offset back to samples rather than msec; also,
%pulling a few samples ahead so you catch the whole song with a little
%wiggle room
onset_song = round((samp_freq*onset_song/1000) - 500);
offset_song = round((samp_freq*offset_song/1000) + 500);

%Now we want to trim the file to the length of the song itself...
trimmed_song = song(onset_song:offset_song);

%Okay, and NOW we want to make sure all the songs conform to a fixed
%length. For us, that's going to be 3000000 units, so let's have a look at
%that in our song....
[r,c] = size(trimmed_song);

if r < 3000000
    for i=r:3000000
        trimmed_song(i,1)=0;
    end
end
