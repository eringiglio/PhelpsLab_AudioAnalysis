function [startOutputs,startOutputs_labels,song] = findPlaybackSongs(fileName,samp_freq,timestamp,filtered)

%This function exists to help me find the beginnings of all songs within a
%60-min recording of a single singing mouse, complete with playbacks. Song
%files should have names in the format DATE_CHAMBER_RECORD_TIME, as in
%'6-10_ch6_2641_10_11_34.F32', or else enter 'n' for parameter timestamp.
% - EMG, 7/5/19.

%if you enter fewer than five arguments, default = you've already filtered
%the songs using rx8Filter. If you haven't run rx8Filter on the recording
%yet, I recommend inputting 'n' for this argument. It will increase the
%runtime and resources but will also make identifying songs much easier and
%more effective.
if nargin <4 
    filtered = 'y';
end

%if you enter fewer than five arguments, default = your song file doesn't
%include a timestamp in it. The recording software automatically appends
%the number of minutes running and the time at which the file was created
%to the name of any file it makes. If your file ends with something like
%[number which is a multiple of 60 + 1]_HH_MM_SS.F32, you may want to
%enable this option by including 'y' in your file. The default is that the
%file will not use this and will assume your file is named
%[something]_playback.F32, and it will trim off that _playback.F32 ending
%and use the rest as an identifier for the pieces it grabs and outputs.
%This is primarily used so that when you take these later to go back over
%the 48h pre-playback recordings, you know exactly which hour-long files to
%pull each recorded song out of. 
if nargin<3
    timestamp = 'n';
end

%threshold = the number of standard deviations in the overall recording
%file to count beyond the mean in order to identify a song. 8 should be
%more than sufficient, but if you need to vary this, it's here.
% if nargin<3
%     threshold = 8;
% end

%If you're working with RX6 data, you'll want your sampling frequency to be
%different. The default for this routine is to use the maximum sampling
%frequency of the RX8.
if nargin<2
    samp_freq = 195312.5/2;
end

%If you haven't yet filtered the recording, this routine will filter it for
%you. I recommend only doing this, as opposed to filtering all recordings
%ahead of time, if you're running a whole bunch of files on a cluster
%machine. If the recording has been filtered already (default), it just
%reads the song from the filename.

%Again, if the timestamp is part of your file name, this routine will
%actually take the time the file started and use it to create the actual
%time of day at which the song was created. If it's not, it will just go
%from 0. Default is that the timestamp is not part of the file name because
%I tweak all my playback files into one 1-hr recording before processing,
%but in batch runs I highly recommend using this feature.

%and having downsampled the songs, that should be evident. 
%While we're at it, we're going to take that threshold line and convert the

%deviations above that mean," so we have a line where any peaks above that
